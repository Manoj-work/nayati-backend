Documentary: CompanyService & Test Approach
🎯 Purpose of CompanyService
The CompanyService class provides core business logic for managing company data within the application. It acts as a service layer between the controller (web layer) and the data repository (persistence layer).

🏗️ Structure Overview
Key Components:

Component	Description
CompanyRepository	Data access layer for CompanyModel operations.
SnowflakeIdGenerator	Generates unique company IDs using Snowflake algorithm.
DuplicateResourceException	Thrown when unique constraints (email/phone) fail.
ResourceNotFoundException	Thrown when a requested company is not found.

⚙️ Service Methods Explained
1️⃣ createCompany(CompanyModel company)
Purpose: Adds a new company to the system after validating uniqueness of email and phone.

Flow:

Checks if email already exists using companyRepository.findByEmail.

Checks if phone number already exists using companyRepository.findByPhone.

Generates unique company ID using snowflakeIdGenerator.nextId.

Saves the company using companyRepository.save.

Exceptions:

DuplicateResourceException if email or phone already exists.

2️⃣ getAllCompanies()
Purpose: Fetches all companies from the database.

Flow:

Calls companyRepository.findAll() to retrieve all records.

3️⃣ updateCompany(String companyId, CompanyModel company)
Purpose: Updates company details for a given companyId.

Flow:

Fetches existing company by ID.

Validates new email and phone for uniqueness if changed.

Updates all fields and saves back to repository.

Exceptions:

ResourceNotFoundException if company doesn't exist.

DuplicateResourceException if updated email/phone already exists in another record.

4️⃣ deleteCompany(String companyId)
Purpose: Deletes a company by its ID.

Flow:

Verifies existence using existsByCompanyId.

Deletes if present.

Exceptions:

DuplicateResourceException if company not found.

5️⃣ getCompanyById(String companyId)
Purpose: Retrieves details of a company by ID.

Flow:

Searches by companyId.

Returns Optional if found, else throws ResourceNotFoundException.

🧪 Test Code (Unit Testing Strategy)
Your test class for CompanyService uses:

Mockito: To mock dependencies like CompanyRepository and SnowflakeIdGenerator.

JUnit5: For test case structure.

Assertions: To validate output and behavior.

Verify: To ensure repository methods are invoked as expected.

✅ Example Test Behaviors:
Test Name	Focus
testCreateCompany_Success	Validates company creation when no duplicates exist.
testCreateCompany_EmailExists	Expects failure when email is already registered.
testUpdateCompany_Success	Tests updating details with valid unique constraints.
testDeleteCompany_Success	Verifies company deletion by ID.
testGetCompanyById_Success	Ensures correct company details are fetched.

Mocking Example:

java
Copy
Edit
when(companyRepository.findByEmail(company.getEmail())).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
when(snowflakeIdGenerator.nextId()).thenReturn(100L);
➡️ Controls the behavior of repository to isolate service logic for testing.

🎬 Summary: Why this Architecture
Separation of concerns via service and repository layers.

Robust validation using exceptions for duplicates and missing records.

Safe unique ID generation via Snowflake algorithm.

Full unit test coverage to ensure service logic behaves correctly in isolation.

📢 Conclusion
This service and its corresponding test suite provide a reliable, maintainable, and scalable approach to managing company entities within your application. Proper mocking and test validation protect the code from regressions and unintended failures, ensuring high code quality.


Full Breakdown of What You Understood — Corrected & Improved
✅ 1st Test - Success Case
java
Copy
Edit
@Test
public void testCreateCompany_Success() {
when(companyRepository.findByEmail(mockCompany.getEmail())).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
when(companyRepository.findByPhone(mockCompany.getPhone())).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
when(snowflakeIdGenerator.nextId()).thenReturn(100L);
when(companyRepository.save(any(CompanyModel.class))).thenReturn(mockCompany);

    CompanyModel savedCompany = companyService.createCompany(mockCompany);

    assertNotNull(savedCompany);
    assertEquals("CID100", savedCompany.getCompanyId());
    verify(companyRepository).save(any(CompanyModel.class));
    System.out.println("Company creation test passed successfully!");
}
🔧 Correct Explanation and Flow
✔️ Mock Setup
when(companyRepository.findByEmail(mockCompany.getEmail())).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
➤ Means: When the service calls findByEmail(email) with the email mockCompany.getEmail(), it returns an empty Optional, simulating no existing company with that email.

when(companyRepository.findByPhone(mockCompany.getPhone())).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
➤ Same logic for the phone number — simulates phone doesn't exist.

when(snowflakeIdGenerator.nextId()).thenReturn(100L);
➤ Snowflake generator returns 100L, so the company ID becomes "CID100" in your service logic.

when(companyRepository.save(any(CompanyModel.class))).thenReturn(mockCompany);
➤ When the service tries to save the company, the repository mock returns the same mockCompany object as if it was saved successfully.

✔️ Execution Flow
companyService.createCompany(mockCompany) is called.

Inside service:

It checks for existing email → gets Optional.empty() → No conflict.

Checks for existing phone → gets Optional.empty() → No conflict.

Generates ID "CID100".

Saves company via repository → returns mockCompany.

In the test:

assertNotNull(savedCompany) ensures the returned company is not null.

assertEquals("CID100", savedCompany.getCompanyId()) verifies the correct ID was set.

verify(companyRepository).save(any(CompanyModel.class)); confirms save was called exactly once.

✅ Result: Test passes, simulating successful company creation.

✅ 2nd Test - Duplicate Email Case
java
Copy
Edit
@Test
public void testCreateCompany_EmailExists() {
when(companyRepository.findByEmail(mockCompany.getEmail())).thenReturn(Optional.of(mockCompany));

    DuplicateResourceException exception = assertThrows(DuplicateResourceException.class, 
        () -> companyService.createCompany(mockCompany));
    
    assertEquals("Email already exists: " + mockCompany.getEmail(), exception.getMessage());
}
✔️ Mock Setup
when(companyRepository.findByEmail(mockCompany.getEmail())).thenReturn(Optional.of(mockCompany));
➤ Simulates that a company with the same email already exists.

✔️ Execution Flow
Call companyService.createCompany(mockCompany).

Inside service:

findByEmail() returns a present Optional → conflict detected.

Service throws DuplicateResourceException.

assertThrows() captures the exception.

assertEquals() verifies the message is correct.

✅ Result: Test passes, confirms that duplicate email scenario triggers the exception properly.

✅ Summary of Your Thought Process (Corrected)
✔️ Mock setup controls repository behavior — not real DB interaction.
✔️ In success test:

Mocks simulate no duplicate found, ID generated, company saved.
✔️ In duplicate email test:

Mocks simulate duplicate email exists → service throws exception.
✔️ Assertions validate both positive and negative outcomes.

✅ Quick Final Clarification
The method when(...).thenReturn(...) works only for that specific method call within the service.

It ensures predictable, test-controlled behavior — no real DB hit.

You're testing the service's business logic response based on controlled mock conditions.
